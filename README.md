# Inspiration

The inspiration for his project came from a product from <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/5128">Adafruit</a>. The current version of project is in development is inspired by <a href="https://www.instructables.com/member/tinyboatproductions">TinyBoatProductions</a>. Full demo <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuQxLqAc5GE">here</a>. The idea is to build the project on a more software base rather than on a hardare level that can be customised by anyone.

# What it does

The project is a macropad that can be used to execute macros or commands on a computer. The project is build using <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3775">Feather M0</a> and <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3711">Featherwing OLED</a>. The project is build on the <a href="

# Plan of Action

<ul>
  <li>Get a barebones version setup and working.</li>
  <li>Work on a script that can alter macros on the fly.</li>
  <li>Get a simple GUI up and ready.</li>
</ul>
